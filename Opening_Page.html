				<p>When I, Nicholas Mendoza, browse my email at midweek, I usually get a weekly email from a newsletter called <a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/midweek-mentor-newsletter" title="Subscribe to Midweek Mentor" target="_blank"><i>Midweek Mentor</i></a> provided by <a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/" title="It's Nice That Website" target="_blank"><i>It's Nice That</i></a>. Every midweek they release a short interview with an indie designer, talking about design tips, favorite designers to follow on Instagram, and what they wanted to become as a six-year-old before being part of the creative industry. The point of the midweek newsletter was to inspire designers with advice and inspiration.</p>

				<p>On this website, I recreate the transcripted interview of Alice Bowsher, an illustrator I discovered in one of the emails on <time datetime="2021-03-17"> March 17, 2021.</time> Her illustration style is playful and childish—Bowsher is an author of some children's books. I also find it charming how she uses black ink to create texture in her illustrations—it makes me reminisce about the illustrated children's books I read before I slept.</p>

					The illustrations in picture books are the first paintings most children see, and because of that, they are incredibly important. What we see and share at the age stays with us for life.
